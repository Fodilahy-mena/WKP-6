# WKP6 - Hungry Student Restaurant

### Another website about food, really...

Yes, but who doesn't like food? üòÑ

This time, we're going to build a food delivery app, where we can see the meal options, select them, and see the result in our cart.

### Users must be able to :

-   See a list of five meal options
-   See the prices of each meal option
-   Add a meal to the cart
-   Filter the list to see only the vegetarian meals, or only the spicy ones
-   See their total bill
-   ‚ÄúCheck out‚Äù - this doesn‚Äôt have to process payment, just simply display
    a message stating the order as been confirmed.

### Bonus :

-   Change the quantity of meals in the cart
-   Remove a meal from the cart

Here is an example of layout :

And when I click on the _Confirm Order_ button, I can display a message to show the total bill from the order.

### Food list

Here's the food object :

```jsx
const foods = [
	{
		id: 'ravitoto',
		price: 5000,
		title: 'Ravitoto',
		spicy: true,
		vegetarian: false,
	},
	{
		id: 'pasta',
		price: 4000,
		title: 'Pasta',
		spicy: true,
		vegetarian: true,
	},
	{
		id: 'burger',
		price: 5000,
		title: 'Burger',
		spicy: false,
		vegetarian: false,
	},
	{
		id: 'rice',
		price: 2000,
		title: 'Rice and Leaves',
		spicy: false,
		vegetarian: true,
	},
	{
		id: 'mofogasy',
		price: 500,
		title: 'Mofogasy',
		spicy: false,
		vegetarian: false,
	},
];
```

The **id** here is a unique string, is role is to identify an element inside the list. The title will be the food name shown to the user.

You'll also have an **order** collection, where you will push a food object every time the user add an element to his order.

### Maps, Filter, Reduce, and other friends

-   To generate any list of element (for example, the list of food), **Map** is really useful.
-   To get the full price of list of items, **Reduce** is the perfect use case.
-   To count how many times an item is in a list, you could **Filter** the list and see the length of the result, or use a **Reduce** to count all of the instances.

But this is just one way to think about that. Feel free to try any other logic you have in mind.

### üí°Tips

-   Don't forget to clean your code, and update your readme before Monday morning.

Good luck!

## Structure of the subject

1. Since *foods* is an array object, I used a map() method to loop through each one of them.

2. That strategy is still used inside of *if* statement when enabling users to choose from two checkbox buttons.

3. That's finished, I tried to add all the information from the food list to the order when clicking on each *add button* but my strategy doesn't worth it so I think I need another method to overcome this.

## Areas in which my work should be improved if I the time wasn't the subject.

1. To be sure, we don't have a lack of time but personally, my strategy to solve problems is very weak and that leads me to the slowness if I can say. For example, to get the html, css and the checkbox buttons work took me more than a half day. So I don't blame the time so I take it instead.

2. I am not going to say if I had more time, (.....). Nop!. But I do say if I was able to accomplish each one steps in a short time I mean (if I was speed), I would at least finish importing all of the information from the `food list` card to the `order` card.

## What I have learnt

1. I noticed that `forEach` loop doesn't work when you want add something one at a time. So when I used it, it only adds one and change it into another one if I click another button.

## Challenging and comments

1. As I said, to get the heckbos buttons worked was already a straggle. But I don't know how hard the other steps because I didn't even get through them.

2. Most importently, I need to hone my ***SPEED!***
